# Introduction to 301

## Overview of 301:

### React: Front end frame work. npm/npx

N.ode
P.ackage
M.anager

React was created by Facebook.

Allows us to use Components/ compentize out our different sections of content to maintain a more readable and maintainable DOM
Virtual Document Object Model: Enhances performance by only updating components that are being changed.


### Classes:

Classes are the building blocks for react.
They are a part of es6 and they allow for Object Oriented Programming.
a blueprint for creating object
a system where we can define objects in relation to other subclass using the keyword `extends`.

### What are components

components are a small piece of code that fills a certain part of the user interface that you build with react.

### What is the difference between an arrow function and a function declaration?

An arrow function doesn't define its own context but resolves callback

a function declaration has access to the `this` keyword.

```javascript
function doSomething(name){
  // does some kind of functionality

}

doSomethingArrow = (name) => {
  // do something else
}

doSomethingOnOneLine = (name) => // do something on one line 2 + 3.

```
